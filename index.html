          <h2>Reason for taking CSCE 445</h2>
          <span>
               This website was developed as an assignment for Dr. Shipman's Computers and New Media class at Texas A&M University. I chose this class because I am curious about the future of interactive media. I love video games and other interactive styles of entertainment. I'm excited to see how mediums like virtual and augmented reality will grow and evolve. I am also interested in helping shape the future of video games.

               The types of media I interact with on a weekly basis can be broken up into 3 main categories: text, video, and audio. Text is then subdivided into means of direct communication such as email and text messaging, but also includes social media like <cite>Twitter</cite>, and news websites such as <cite>Ars Technica</cite>, <cite>Eurogamer</cite>, and <cite>Giant Bomb</cite>. Audio includes music sources such as <cite>Spotify</cite> and <cite>SoundCloud</cite>, but also includes weekly podcasts such as the <cite>NPR Politics</cite> podcast, <cite>The Indicator</cite>, <cite>Planet Money</cite>, the <cite>Giant Bombcast</cite>, and <cite>My Brother, My Brother and Me</cite>. Video can be subdivided in to more traditional video media viewed on the internet such as YouTube and anime, while it also includes video games such as <cite>Fire Emblem: Heroes</cite> and <cite>Overwatch</cite>.
