     <div id="reason">
          <h2>Common Reasons for Taking the Class</h2>
          <span>
               There was a significant diversity in individual's reasons for taking this course. I only found one other student that shared a similar interest in specifically shaping the future of video games. This student was <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~asleal2/csce_445.html">Andrew Leal</a>.

          <h2>Common Interest in Giant Bomb</h2>
          <span>
               I found another student who had an interest in Giant Bomb, <a href="https://amos960.wixsite.com/csce445">Cameron Amos</a>.

     <div id="spotify">
          <h2>Common Usage of Spotify</h2>
          <span>
               Pretty much every student had some sort of interest in music. Not all listed how they got their music, but a large portion of the class used Spotify as at least one of their means of listening to music. This included <a href="https://ablasband.wixsite.com/445bio">Aaron Blasband</a>, <a href="https://cassiebub.wixsite.com/csce445">Cassie Bub</a>, <a href="https://imaginenat.me/csce445/">Natalie Cluck</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~jhaney/">Joseph Haney</a>, <a href="https://laurkleck.github.io/445_Personal_Page/">Lauren Kleckner</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~brlopez494/csce445.html">Bishop Lopez</a>, <a href="https://huntercomputers.wordpress.com/">Hunter Lukken</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/eileen-madrigal/home">Eileen Madrigal</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~piko567/">Nathan Manickavasagam</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~s501880/index.html">Renee McCoy</a>, <a href="https://isaac2850.wixsite.com/isaacoviedo">Isaac Oviedo</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/japhelan">Jonathon Phelan</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/tamu.edu/ryan-pigeon-csce-445/">Ryan Pigeon</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/csce465josh/">Joshua Rao</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~sapp.joey/">Joey Sapp</a>, <a href="https://tstephenson2415.wixsite.com/csce445">Taylor Stephenson</a>, <a href="http://www.sutorus.com/index.html#">Josef Sutorus</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~ctsao68/">Christopher Tsao</a>, and <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~uyenvo/">Uyen Vo</a>.

     <div id="soundcloud">
          <h2>Common Usage of SoundCloud</h2>
          <span>
               I found it surprising that even fewer students shared my interest in SoundCloud. These students included: <a href="https://jackie-gonzalez.weebly.com/">Jacqueline Gonzalez</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/tamu.edu/ghruzek/">Grant Hruzek</a>, and <a href="https://huntercomputers.wordpress.com/">Hunter Lukken</a>.

     <div id="anime">
          <h2>Common Interest in Anime</h2>

               I found only one other student that shared my interest in anime, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~cw4674/">Christopher Wilcoxen</a>.

     <div id="overwatch">
          <h2>Common Interest in Overwatch</h2>
          <span>
               A vast majority of students engaged with video games of one type or another, but I found several students who shared a similar interest in the game Overwatch. These students were <a href="https://jackie-gonzalez.weebly.com/">Jacqueline Gonzalez</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~feress12/">Spencer Harder</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/tamu.edu/ghruzek/">Grant Hruzek</a>, <a href="https://jcj2905.github.io/CSCE-445-Website/">Justin Jin</a>, <a href="https://csce445kdkoiner.wordpress.com/2018/01/24/445kdk/">Kyle Koiner</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/japhelan">Jonathon Phelan</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~hectorp55/new-media/">Juan Hector Guadalupe Puga</a>, <a href="http://www.sutorus.com/index.html#">Josef Sutorus</a>, and <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~ssy96/445a1">Simon Sy</a>

     <div id="podcasts">
          <h2>Common Interest in Podcasts</h2>
          <span>
               There were several other students who also listened to podcasts, however I found no overlap with my particular subset of podcasts, which I fould very surprising.
